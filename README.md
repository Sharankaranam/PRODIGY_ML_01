üè° Predicting Housing Prices with Advanced Regression Techniques! üè°
Overview
This project involves predicting housing prices using advanced regression techniques. The goal was to develop a model that accurately estimates house prices based on various features such as the number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and area.

Project Overview
Data Preparation
Dataset: HOUSING.CSV
Features:
bathrooms
bedrooms
area
Target:
price
Preprocessing:
Scaled features using StandardScaler.
Applied PolynomialFeatures to capture non-linear relationships.
Model Training and Evaluation
Data Splitting:
Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
Model:
Applied Ridge Regression to account for potential overfitting and enhance model performance.
Evaluation:
Used cross-validation to assess model performance and calculated performance metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 Score.
Performance Metrics
Cross-Validated Mean Squared Error: Provided insight into the model‚Äôs performance across different subsets of data.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Evaluated the accuracy of the predictions on the test set.
R^2 Score: Measured the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the features.
Predictive Insights
The model was used to predict housing prices for new data points, providing valuable insights into price estimation based on various features.
Key Outcomes
Performance: Achieved robust performance metrics with Ridge Regression, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting housing prices.
Enhancements: Successfully implemented feature scaling and polynomial features to improve model accuracy.
